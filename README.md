# 🩺 MediBot: AI-Powered Medical Diagnostic Assistant

#### MediBot is an AI-driven web application that helps users explore potential diseases based on reported symptoms. It combines a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for prediction with an LLM-powered chatbot for interactive, educational health consultations.

***✨ Features***

- 🔍 Symptom-Based Disease Prediction
- Select from 337+ symptoms with a searchable, drag-and-drop interface. A trained 1D-CNN model predicts possible diseases with confidence scores.
- 🤖 Interactive AI Chat
Post-prediction, consult a Gemini-powered LLM (via LangChain) for explanations, treatment suggestions, and health tips in clear, empathetic language.
- 🔐 User Authentication & Profile Management
Secure JWT-based authentication (with refresh tokens). Update profile info and manage login sessions safely.
- 💬 Chat History Persistence
Conversations stored in SQLite, accessible via a sidebar for easy navigation.
- ⚙️ System Health Monitoring
Includes backend health-check endpoint to verify service status.

**🛠️ Architecture**

*MediBot uses a client–server architecture:*

- *Backend (FastAPI)*
- Auth: JWT tokens, password hashing (bcrypt).
- Prediction: TensorFlow 1D-CNN trained on symptom-disease dataset.
- Chat: Integrated LLM (Google Generative AI via LangChain).
- Database: SQLite (users, chat logs, tokens).

- *Frontend (React + TypeScript)*
- UI: Built with React 18, TailwindCSS, and shadcn/ui components.
- Navigation: React Router.
- Features: Symptom selector, prediction dashboard, chat interface, sidebar history, and authentication pages.

***Data Flow***

- User selects symptoms → sends to backend.
- Backend runs CNN prediction → creates chat session.
- LLM manages ongoing chat.
- Frontend displays results + stored history.
